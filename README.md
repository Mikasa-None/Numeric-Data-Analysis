Data
• MAGIC04.mat
• 10 real attributes.
Questions:
• Compute the multivariate mean vector.
• Compute the sample covariance matrix as inner products between the columns of the
centered data matrix.
• Compute the sample covariance matrix as outer product between the centered data
points.
• Compute the correlation between Attributes 1 and 2 by computing the cosine of the angle
between the centered attribute vectors. Plot the scatter plot between these two attributes.
• Assuming that Attribute 1 is normally distributed, plot its probability density function.
• Which attribute has the largest variance, and which attribute has the smallest variance?
Print these values.
• Which pair of attributes has the largest covariance, and which pair of attributes has the
smallest covariance? Print these values.
